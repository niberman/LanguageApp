# La Escuela de Idiomas - "Â¡Empecemos a hablar!"

## Overview

"La Escuela de Idiomas" is a production-ready, Spanish-only language learning platform designed to facilitate language acquisition through structured content and interactive activities. Its core purpose is to provide an engaging and effective learning experience, leveraging embedded external resources and a clear, hierarchical content model. The platform supports a freemium model with a focus on user progress tracking and a streamlined, intuitive user interface. The project aims to become a leading platform for Spanish speakers to learn new languages, starting with English.

## Recent Changes

### âœ… Password Reset Persistence Fix (October 28, 2025)
**Fixed password reset page redirecting to login:**

- **Problem**: Password reset link from email would briefly show the password update form, then immediately redirect to login page
- **Root Cause**: Supabase clears URL hash after processing recovery token, causing the app to lose track of the password reset flow
- **Solution**: Password reset state now persists once detected, preventing unwanted redirects
- **Result**: Users can now reliably update their password after clicking the reset link

  - Prevents duplicate courses automatically

## User Preferences

- **Design System**: Material Design-inspired with warm, encouraging aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Primary (orange/amber), accent (teal/cyan), warm neutrals
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with readable fonts
- **Components**: shadcn/ui with custom theming
- **Interactions**: Smooth transitions, hover states, active states
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first, works on all screen sizes

## System Architecture

The application uses a **hybrid database architecture**:

- **Frontend**: React 18 (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Wouter, TanStack Query)
- **Backend**: Express.js (Drizzle ORM)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (email/password, Google OAuth, password reset)
- **Database**: Replit PostgreSQL (all application data - courses, lessons, activities, progress)

**Important**: Supabase is used ONLY for authentication. All course content and user progress data is stored in Replit's PostgreSQL database, not in Supabase's database. This is why you won't see application tables when viewing the Supabase dashboard - it only shows auth-related data (users, sessions).

### UI/UX Decisions
The UI is exclusively in Spanish, with a dark mode option and theme persistence. It features a clean, responsive design based on shadcn/ui components with custom theming, adhering to a Material Design-inspired aesthetic with a warm color palette.

### Technical Implementations
- **OOP Content Hierarchy**: A robust, object-oriented content model (`Course` â†’ `Lesson` â†’ `Topic` â†’ `Activity`) is implemented using TypeScript classes, providing a clear and scalable structure for learning content.
- **Activity Types**: Supports `VideoActivity` (embedded YouTube), `QuizletActivity` (embedded Quizlet flashcards), and `AIChatActivity` (planned for conversational practice).
- **Authentication**: Utilizes Supabase for email/password and Google OAuth, managing user sessions and protected routes.
- **Progress Tracking**: Activity completion is tracked via the `activity_completions` table, enabling streak counters and overall progress percentages on the user dashboard.
- **Localization**: Full Spanish localization for all UI elements and content.
- **Database Seeding**: An `/api/admin/seed` endpoint allows for one-click production database seeding with sample Spanish content.
- **Password Reset**: Full password reset functionality is integrated with Supabase and a localized UI.

### Feature Specifications
- **Course System**: Hierarchical content organization allows for clear learning paths.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays personalized learning statistics including streaks and progress.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides tools for content management and user analytics (future implementation).
- **Spanish-Only UI**: All interface and content are presented in Spanish, with no language switching option.

### System Design Choices
- **Type-safe Development**: `shared/schema.ts` ensures consistency between frontend and backend.
- **Hierarchical Data Loading**: The backend efficiently loads complete course hierarchies in single queries.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query manages data fetching and cache invalidation.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes Replit Secrets for secure storage of API keys and database credentials, with an auto-fix feature for common configuration errors.

## External Dependencies

    - PostgreSQL Database
    - Authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth)
    - Storage (for future media assets)
- **YouTube**: Embedded video lessons within `VideoActivity` components.
