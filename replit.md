## User Preferences

- **Design System**: Material Design-inspired with warm, encouraging aesthetics
- **Color Palette**: Primary (orange/amber), accent (teal/cyan), warm neutrals
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with readable fonts
- **Components**: shadcn/ui with custom theming
- **Interactions**: Smooth transitions, hover states, active states
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first, works on all screen sizes

## System Architecture

The application is built with a React 18 frontend (TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Wouter, TanStack Query) and an Express.js backend (Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL via Supabase).

### UI/UX Decisions
The UI is exclusively in Spanish, with a dark mode option and theme persistence. It features a clean, responsive design based on shadcn/ui components with custom theming, adhering to a Material Design-inspired aesthetic with a warm color palette.

### Technical Implementations
- **OOP Content Hierarchy**: A robust, object-oriented content model (`Course` â†’ `Lesson` â†’ `Topic` â†’ `Activity`) is implemented using TypeScript classes, providing a clear and scalable structure for learning content.
- **Activity Types**: Supports `VideoActivity` (embedded YouTube), `QuizletActivity` (embedded Quizlet flashcards), and `AIChatActivity` (planned for conversational practice).
- **Authentication**: Utilizes Supabase for email/password and Google OAuth, managing user sessions and protected routes.
- **Progress Tracking**: Activity completion is tracked via the `activity_completions` table, enabling streak counters and overall progress percentages on the user dashboard.
- **Localization**: Full Spanish localization for all UI elements and content.
- **Database Seeding**: An `/api/admin/seed` endpoint allows for one-click production database seeding with sample Spanish content.
- **Password Reset**: Full password reset functionality is integrated with Supabase and a localized UI.

### Feature Specifications
- **Course System**: Hierarchical content organization allows for clear learning paths.
- **User Dashboard**: Displays personalized learning statistics including streaks and progress.
- **Admin Panel**: Provides tools for content management and user analytics (future implementation).
- **Spanish-Only UI**: All interface and content are presented in Spanish, with no language switching option.

### System Design Choices
- **Type-safe Development**: `shared/schema.ts` ensures consistency between frontend and backend.
- **Hierarchical Data Loading**: The backend efficiently loads complete course hierarchies in single queries.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query manages data fetching and cache invalidation.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes Replit Secrets for secure storage of API keys and database credentials, with an auto-fix feature for common configuration errors.

## External Dependencies

- **Supabase**:
    - PostgreSQL Database
    - Authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth)
    - Storage (for future media assets)
- **YouTube**: Embedded video lessons within `VideoActivity` components.
- **Quizlet**: Embedded flashcard sets within `QuizletActivity` components.
